# gpt_prompts

Simple repo for my GPT prompts that I like to use.

---

I've collected some prompts from around the Internet and am posting them here for future reference. Some are direct copies, others were fed into ChatGPT Plus to make a custome GPT. Play around with them to find something that works for you.

You can also use them in your local LLMs to start a conversation on the topic at hand.
